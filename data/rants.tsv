You add a dynamic allocator that will work *horribly* badly if people actually start using it for more complex cases, and then you use that for just about the least interesting case. And the way you do the dynamic allocator, nobody can ever allocate one of the wait-queue entries *efficiently* by just knowing that they are a leaf and there is never any recursive allocation....
